	// RoleVersionsForKICVersions is a map that explicitly sets which ClusterRole version to use upon the KIC
	// version. It is used by /hack/generators/kic-role-generator to generate the roles to be used by KIC.
	// The file /internal/utils/kubernetes/resources/zz_generated_clusterrole_helpers.go is generated out of this map.
	// This data follows the semver constraint syntax (see https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#basic-comparisons)
	// to set the range of KIC versions to be associated with a specific role version.
	//
	// e.g., for KIC with a version lower than "2.4", but greater or equal to "2.3", version "2.3" of the role is used.
	//
	// Whenever the KIC ClusterRole is updated and released, that change should be reflected in this map,
	// and the generator should be run again to produce the new ClusterRole files.
	//
	// e.g., when in the future new permissions will be granted to KIC, and that update will be included in
	// the release 5.0, a new entry '">=5.0": "5.0"' should be added to this map, and the previous most
	// updated entry should be limited to "<5.0".
